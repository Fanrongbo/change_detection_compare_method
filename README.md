# change_detection_compare_method
   This repository contains some good performance and representative algorithms of Remote Sensing Change Detection. At present, there are five method in first version, including Multivariate Alteration Detection (MAD), Iteratively Reweighted Multivariate Alteration Detection (IR-MAD), Slow Feature Analysis (SFA), Iteratively Slow Feature Analysis (ISFA), Unsupervised Deep Slow Feature Analysis (DSFA). All of project can run directly.
   In order to evaluate the performance of each algorithms, I also upload the program of evalution criteria including Overall Accuracy, Recall, Precision, Kappa, Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve.
   According to the type of experimental data, dividing into two catalogues include one_classify and two_classify.
1. The experimental data in one_classify folder mean all of image pixels is vaild data.
2. The experimental data in two_classify folder mean some of image pixels is vaild data, which means some samples have no meaning.

The data is open-source in network.
